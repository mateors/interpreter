# Interpreter | Token | Lexer | Parser

Students I am going to write a brand new interpreter in golang from scratch. If you really care about learning something new and from scratch then this is the place to start. You can start following my github profile and get my project status on regular basis. I push almost everyday and multiple times with the detail which are helpful for learners.

## When you tokenize
* Everything must be tokenize
* Each character must match a token
* Unsupported characters are usually tokenize as ILLEGAL
