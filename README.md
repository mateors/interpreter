# Interpreter | Token | Lexer | Parser

Students I am going to write a brand new interpreter in golang from scratch. If you really care about learning something new and from scratch then this is the place to start. You can start following my GitHub profile and get my project status on regular basis. I push almost every day and multiple times with detailed instructions which are helpful for learners.

## When you tokenize
* Everything (source code, your input) must be tokenize
* Each character must match a token
* Unsupported characters are usually tokenize as ILLEGAL
